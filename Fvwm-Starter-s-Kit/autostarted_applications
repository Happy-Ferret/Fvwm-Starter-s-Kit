#  Specify the applications you would
#  like to start with fvwm.
#  
#  Typically they are panel, tray, system
#  monitor, power manager, network manager,
#  an application to display wallpaper, 
#  clipboard manager, applications like 
#  internet messengers and mail clients
#  and whatever you want. 
#
#  InitFunction is executed when you start
#  fvwm:

DestroyFunc InitFunction
AddToFunc   InitFunction
+ I Exec exec command --option --if --necessary

#  These who use more than one keyboard
#  layouts can set up layouts switching
#  here:

#  setxkbmap -layout  "us,ru(winkeys)" -model "pc105" -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll"

#  For advanced switching options try fbxkb, 
#  xneur etc.
#
#  Unlike InitFunction, StartFunction is 
#  executed each time fvwm is started AND 
#  restarted.
#  Make sure you start FVWM modules you need
#  here as shown below:
#  
#  Try FvwmBacker to set different wallpapers
#  for different pages and different desktops
#  (see backer file for details)


DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmCommandS
+ I Module FvwmAnimate
+ I Module FvwmButtons
+ I Module FvwmBacker
+ I Module FvwmAnimate
