#  fvwm's special: the keybindings.
#  The syntax is 
#  Key (optionally - window name) Your_Key_Name Context Modifier Action
#
#  - You can optionally define a hotkey depending on active window
#  title.
#  Type the exact window title or use symbols and wildcards in brackets,
#  e.g. (gedit) or (*edit*).
#
#  - Your_Key_Name is any key except for modifiers, name can be obtained
#  using xev except for PrtSc which is Print
#
#  - Contexts understood by fvwm are:
#
#  R - Root window
#  I - Iconified window
#  F - window decoration corner
#  S - window decoration side
#  T - window decoration title
#  W - active window
#  0-9 - titlebar buttons (see corresponding file)
#  M - Menu
#  A - any context
#
#  You can combine contexts: FWST etc.
#
#  - Modifiers are:
#  ctrl - C
#  super - 4
#  alt - 1
#  shift - S
#  caps - L
#  num - 2
#
#  Again, you can combine modifiers: 1S, 4S, etc. 
#  
#  If you use multiple desktops, set desktop switching 
#  here, the command is GotoDesk 0...n
#  Here are some bindings to manage your windows and
#  launch some applications, but you can set much
#  more of them and tune them really fine.
#  Use Exec exec to run applications.
