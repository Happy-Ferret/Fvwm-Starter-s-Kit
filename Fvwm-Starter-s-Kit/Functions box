#  THIS FILE IS NOT A PART OF CONFIGURATION
#  It is just a set of different functions
#  with brief explanations what they do.
#  
#  You can use them (or not) in your setup -
#  just copy ones you like to functions 
#  file and bind them.
#
#  Once you wrote a function, you 
#  can invoke it from anywhere in
#  your fvwm config and bind it
#  to hotkey or mouse or window
#  decoration button or a menu item.
#  
#  Binding functions to keys and
#  buttons is described in keybindings_and_mouse
#  file. Detailed explanation of
#  functions syntax can be found in
#  fvwm beginner's guide or in a
#  manual.
#  
#  Here are some functions most
#  stacking window managers users
#  would like to work out of the box:


#  Close window - for titlebar button
#  and keybinding
